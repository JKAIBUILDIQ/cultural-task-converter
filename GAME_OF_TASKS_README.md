## 🧮 Acceleration Multiplier

**Key Innovation**: Measures learning velocity, not just completion speed.

### Calculation Factors:
- **Improvement Rate**: How fast PaiT rating increases over time
- **Consistency**: Regular engagement and completion patterns  
- **Difficulty Progression**: Successfully tackling harder challenges
- **Peer Interaction**: Contributing to community through reviews

### Special Consideration:
> *"Speed of learning could make a world of difference for a kid in Somalia"*

The acceleration multiplier acts as an equalizer - students with limited resources but high learning velocity can climb rankings faster than those with advantages but slower learning curves.

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### AI Grading System
- **Code Analysis**: Functionality, efficiency, style
